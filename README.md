This project focuses on Titanic dataset - predicting survival based on various factors. 

#### The following regression algorithm was implemented and evaluated:
* Logistic Regression
* Decision Tree Classifier usig Hyperparameter grid to search
* Model evaluated based on K-fold cross-validation using cross_val_score() function and cross_validate() function

#### Feature selection
* Recursive feature elimination (RFE) is used to remove least important features
* Find best number of features and feature ranking with Recursive feature elimination (RFE) and cross-validation
##### Plotted ROC-AUC Curve
